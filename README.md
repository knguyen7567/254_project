# Project Description
Imagine designing and developing a dynamic web application capable of serving specific user
needs or solving a particular problem. Your task is to build this web application and establish a
secure and efficient Linux-based server infrastructure to host it. Here's an overview of what you'll achieve:

**1. Web Application Development:**
> - Dive into web development to create your dynamic web application using a suitable technology stack as mentioned.
> - Customize the application to meet your project's specific requirements and user expectations.

**2. Automation with Shell Scripts:**
> - Master the art of shell scripting to automate routine server tasks. Implement scripts for data backups, log file management, and system maintenance.

**3. Package Management:**
> - Use your distribution's package manager to install and configure necessary software components, including web servers, databases, and programming languages.

**4. Project Presentation:**
> - Prepare a comprehensive project presentation that showcases your web application and the Linux-based server infrastructure you've built.
> - Emphasize the role of open source software, discuss software licenses, and highlight the significance of Linux in modern web development.

##### Build and host the application on a Linux based server/machine.
>
##### This project offers you a unique opportunity to gain hands-on experience in creating a real-world web application while simultaneously exploring the diverse world of Linux and open-source software. It's a journey of learning, innovation, and skill development that will equip you with valuable expertise for future technology projects.
